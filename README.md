# CS210-Project

Our project was about understanding the relationship between the real results and the survey results of the presidental election that was held on the 14th of May 2023. We used a dataset that showed the election results city by city, candidate by candidate. We also used a self created dataset that had survey information of several survey companies about the distribution of the vote percentage of the candidates. Our aim was to understand if these surveys were consistent with the real results of the elections.We tried to understand which aspects of these surveys would make it more proportional to the real results. The date, the number of participants are some of these aspects of the proportionality between the survey results and real result.After visualizing our data as graphs, we have seen, that the scope of the graph, the diversity of participants, the date that the survey was held, and the region in which the survey was held are the main aspects when it comes to understanding the relation  of similarity between the surveys and the real results.
